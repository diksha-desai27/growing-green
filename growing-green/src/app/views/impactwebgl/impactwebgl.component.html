              Time to play
            </h4>

            When kids have access to safe water, there is more time to play.
            After a day at school, summer, holidays—these are times for fun and
            play. Yet, for the millions of kids who don't have access to safe
            water at home, such carefree joys are a world away. Instead of play,
            or even time to go to school, millions of children share with their
            mothers the burden of water collection.They spend a collective 200
            million hours each day walking to collect it. And the water they
            find may not be safe to drink, but they have little choice but to
            risk consuming it. This is why every two minutes a child dies of
            water-related disease, and more than one million people die each
            year from the same. The price of play shouldn’t be so high. That’s
            why we give our everything every day to change it.

              Promote Clean Energy
            </h4>

            As global energy demands continue to rise, we’re working with
            governments to show how renewable energy can grow economies while
            reducing carbon emissions. The threat posed by the earth’s changing
            climate is substantial. The Risky Business Project of former
            Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and others estimates the property
            value of the land lost to sea level rise in the tens of billions of
            dollars over the next 35 years. It also estimates millions in lost
            productivity due to the increase in extreme heat days and impacts to
            crop cycles and human health. We are encouraged by a growing
            bipartisan consensus around the need to find workable and effective
            solutions—we applaud the creation of the new Senate Climate
            Solutions Caucus in October 2019, following in the footsteps of the
            similar effort in the House.

              Building Resilience
            </h4>
            We’re helping the most vulnerable communities adapt to climate
            change by restoring habitats, such as mangroves that reduce the
            impact of severe storms. Natural climate solutions are conservation,
            restoration and improved land management actions that increase
            carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in landscapes and
            wetlands across the globe. Combined with innovations in clean energy
            and other efforts to decarbonize the world’s economies, natural
            climate solutions offer some of our best options in the response to
            climate change.New research, led by The Nature Conservancy and 15
            other institutions*, and published in the Proceedings of the
            National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that nature-based
            solutions can provide up to 37 percent of the emission reductions
            needed by 2030 to keep global temperature increases under 2°C—30
            percent more than previously estimated.

          The Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP) was launched in
          2013 to solve a problem: if the Conservancy and other organizations
          were going to persuade people – businesses and governments especially
          – to make big investments in nature to improve human well-being's it
          needed to provide hard data on what the return on those investments
          would or wouldn’t be. But delivering that kind of science and evidence
          is an expensive, complex challenge and one no organization could
          accomplish alone – the Conservancy certainly couldn’t afford to keep
          that much science, policy and data management expertise on staff.

          The Conservancy’s Center for Sustainability Science works with
          businesses and policymakers to develop solutions – grounded in
          conservation science – that benefit both the environment and the
          economy. Companies and communities rely on nature for everything: from
          maintaining resource streams to filtering the air and water to
          protecting their factories from floods. As ecosystems are degraded,
          their ability to continue to provide these often undervalued or taken
          for granted services is limited. Businesses are increasingly looking
          to innovative natural solutions in support of their activities.

          TNC established the NatureNet Science Fellows Program in partnership
          with a rotating set of the world’s leading universities to create a
          reservoir of new interdisciplinary science talent that will carry out
          the new work of conservation. Fellows and grantees will work with a
          Nature Conservancy mentor and a hosting senior scholar (or scholars)
          to develop a research program. This joint mentorship model allows for
          fellows and grantees to take fundamental research questions and the
          traditional support provided by universities and embed themselves in
          the practice of applied conservation through TNC networks.
